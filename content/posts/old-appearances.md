I have done a number of talks and appeared in a number of videos over the years. It has been some time since many of these videos and talks have been made (mostly over 5 years from this date), but there are some interesting nuggets amongst them. Most of these are on applications of machine learning in finance - you may find them interesting.


# Talks
## Thrifting Alpha
**Thrifting alpha** is a talk about using ensemble learning to combine low alpha (weakly predictive) signals for algorithmic trading into stronger composite signals for trading a portfolio of stocks.

## Buying Happiness
**Buying happiness** is a talk about using natural language processing and sentiment classification to create trading signals based off Twitter data. We take this signal and compose a strategy for broad equity investing based on

## Basic statistical arbitrage
**Basic statistical arbitrage** is an introductory talk around using statistics to find signals for trading in financial markets where your models give you an edge. This talk in particular is about **pairs trading**, where you find pairs of equities that move together and make trading decisions around your predictions of their movement.

# Podcasts

## Chats with Traders
[Chats with traders](https://chatwithtraders.com/) is a podcast that I spoke on some time ago about the challenges of using machine learning in finance. You can find a recording of that conversation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj5sXWv9SDM).


# Writing

## Books
Bit of a misnomer here, as I haven't written any books in their entirety [yet], but I did some work on ["Bayesian Methods for Hackers"](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) porting it to PyMC3, which was a substantial version change from PyMC.

## Quantopian
Much of this volume of content was produced when I worked at a startup where we did a lot of education for the community. Beyond the above live recordings, there was a very large quantity of lectures on statistics, machine learning, quantitative finance, and algorithmic trading. [This repo](https://github.com/mmargenot/research_public) contains most, if not all, of that content, with [this directory](https://github.com/mmargenot/research_public/tree/master/notebooks/lectures) in particular being the one with the lectures in it.


# Everywhere else
And [here's a broad youtube query](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=max+margenot) that will probably capture the rest.
