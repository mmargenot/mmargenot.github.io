I have done a number of talks and appeared in a number of videos over the years. It has been some time since many of these videos and talks have been made (mostly over 5 years from this date), but there are some interesting nuggets amongst them.

[Chats with traders](https://chatwithtraders.com/) is a podcast that I spoke on some time ago about the challenges of using machine learning in finance. You can find a recording of that conversation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj5sXWv9SDM).


# Everywhere else
And [here's a broad youtube query](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=max+margenot) that will probably capture the rest.
