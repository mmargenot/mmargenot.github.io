      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have done a number of talks and appeared in a number of videos over the years. It has been some time since many of these videos and talks have been made (mostly over 5 years from this date), but there are some interesting nuggets amongst them. Most of these are on applications of machine learning in finance - you may find them interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;talks&#34;&gt;Talks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thrifting-alpha&#34;&gt;Thrifting Alpha&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thrifting alpha&lt;/strong&gt; is a talk about using ensemble learning to combine low alpha (weakly predictive) signals for algorithmic trading into stronger composite signals for trading a portfolio of stocks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
